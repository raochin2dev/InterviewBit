
/* Euclid's Theorem for GCD 

Since the remainders decrease with every step but can never be negative, a remainder rN must eventually equal zero, at which point the algorithm stops.[13] The final nonzero remainder rNâˆ’1 is the greatest common divisor of a and b. The number N cannot be infinite because there are only a finite number of nonnegative integers between the initial remainder r0 and zero.
